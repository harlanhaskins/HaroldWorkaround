# Harold Workaround

Harold is designed to read `harold.mp3` out of your CSH home directory.

This is a python server that acts as an intermediary and moves files as necessary.

## Installation

* Run `bash harold_install.sh`
* Create a python virtual environment.
* Inside that virtualenv, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python server.py [password]`

Then run the companion app on your iPhone or iPad, and enter the port number and password into the configuration window.

# Why?
Because.
